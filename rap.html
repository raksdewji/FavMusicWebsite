          <h2>About Rap Music</h2>
          <p>
            Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, or MCing) is a musical form
            of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and
            street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of
            ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment. The
            components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow"
            (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from
            spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed in time to
            musical accompaniment. Rap being a primary ingredient of hip hop
            music, it is commonly associated with that genre in particular;
            however, the origins of rap precede hip-hop culture. The earliest
            precursor to modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in
            which "oral historians", or "praise-singers", would disseminate oral
            traditions and genealogies, or use their rhetorical techniques for
            gossip or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions
            connect to rap along a lineage of black verbal reverence,[definition
            needed] through James Brown interacting with the crowd and the band
            between songs, to Muhammad Ali's verbal taunts and the poems of The
            Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black
            rhetorical continuum", and aim to reuse elements of past traditions
            while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and
            rhetorical styles and strategies". The person credited with
            originating the style of "delivering rhymes over extensive music",
            that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway
            from Harlem, New York.

            Rap is a vocal technique, while hip-hop is a subculture. Rap only
            makes up one part of hip-hop, so the two terms are not
            interchangeable. Afrika Bambaataa was one of the most important
            figures in the early development of hip-hop and articulated the four
            elements that made up the subculture: DJing, b-boying (also known as
            breakdancing), graffiti writing, and MCing. Rapping is another word
            for MCing.

            Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ,
            turntablist, beatboxer, or performed a cappella without
            accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between
            speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the
            musical form, originally meant "to lightly strike",[10] and is now
            used to describe quick speech or repartee.[11] The word had been
            used in British English since the 16th century. It was part of the
            African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning "to
            converse", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term
            denoting the musical style.[12] Today, the term rap is so closely
            associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms
            interchangeably.
