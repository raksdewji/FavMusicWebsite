          <h2>About Hip-Hop Music</h2>
          <p>
            Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the
            1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York
            City, particularly among African-American youth residing in the
            Bronx. At block parties DJs played percussive breaks of popular
            songs using two turntables and a DJ mixer to be able to play breaks
            from two copies of the same record, alternating from one to the
            other and extending the "break". Hip hop's early evolution occurred
            as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and
            affordable. Turntablist techniques such as scratching and
            beatmatching developed along with the breaks and Jamaican toasting,
            a chanting vocal style, was used over the beats. Rapping developed
            as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or chants along
            rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat.

            Hip hop music was not officially recorded for play on radio or
            television until 1979, largely due to poverty during the genre's
            birth and lack of acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods. Old
            school hip hop was the first mainstream wave of the genre, marked by
            its disco influence and party-oriented lyrics. The 1980s marked the
            diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex
            styles and spread around the world. New school hip hop was the
            genre's second wave, marked by its electro sound, and led into
            Golden age hip hop, an innovative period between the mid-1980s and
            mid-1990s. The gangsta rap subgenre, focused on the violent
            lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city
            African-American youth, gained popularity at this time. West Coast
            hip hop was dominated by G-funk in the early-mid 1990s, while East
            Coast hip hop was dominated by jazz rap, alternative hip hop, and
            hardcore rap. Hip hop continued to diversify at this time with other
            regional styles emerging, such as Southern rap and Atlanta hip hop.
            Hip hop became a best-selling genre in the mid-1990s and the
            top-selling music genre by 1999.

            The popularity of hip hop music continued through the late 1990s to
            mid-2000s with hip hop influences increasingly finding their way
            into other genres of popular music, such as neo soul, nu metal, and
            R&B. The United States also saw the success of regional styles such
            as crunk, a Southern genre that emphasized the beats and music more
            than the lyrics, and alternative hip hop began to secure a place in
            the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of its artists.
            During the late 2000s and early 2010s "blog era", rappers were able
            to build up a following through online methods of music
            distribution, such as social media and blogs, and mainstream hip hop
            took on a more melodic, sensitive direction following the commercial
            decline of gangsta rap. The trap and mumble rap subgenres have
            become the most popular form of hip hop during the mid-late 2010s
            and early 2020s. In 2017, rock music was usurped by hip hop as the
            most popular genre in the United States.
