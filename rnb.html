          <h2>About R&B Music</h2>
          <p>
            Rhythm and blues, abbreviated as R&B, is a genre of popular music
            that originated in African American communities in the 1940s. The
            term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings
            marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when
            "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat" was
            becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music
            typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted
            of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones,
            and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often
            encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest
            for freedom and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of
            relationships, economics, and aspirations.
          </p>

            The term "rhythm and blues" has undergone a number of shifts in
            meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently applied to blues
            records. Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music
            contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term "R&B"
            became used to refer to music styles that developed from and
            incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. In
            the 1960s, several British rock bands such as the Rolling Stones,
            the Who and the Animals were referred to and promoted as being R&B
            bands; posters for the Who's residency at the Marquee Club in 1964
            contained the slogan, "Maximum R&B". Their mix of rock and roll and
            R&B is now known as "British rhythm and blues". By the 1970s, the
            term "rhythm and blues" changed again and was used as a blanket term
            for soul and funk. In the 1980s, a newer style of R&B developed,
            becoming known as "contemporary R&B". It combines rhythm and blues
            with elements of pop, soul, funk, disco, hip hop, and electronic
            music. Popular R&B vocalists at the end of the 20th century included
            Prince, R. Kelly, Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan, Michael Jackson,
            Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey. In the 21st century, R&B has
            remained a popular genre, becoming more pop-oriented and
            alternative-influenced, with successful artists including Beyonc√©,
            Rihanna, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo, Bruno Mars, SZA, Robin Thicke, and The
            Weeknd.
