          <h2>Why Music?</h2>
          <p>
            In the course of history, music is the greatest creation of mankind.
            Creativity in the pure and undiluted form is the true definition of
            Music. Music is an important part of our life as it is a way of
            expressing our feelings as well as emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people consider music as a way to escape from the pain of life.
            It gives you relief and allows you to reduce the stress. Music is a
            powerful therapy that will make you calm down and in the moment of
            joy, it will make you cheerful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, it develops the mind and boosts your self confidence.
            Music plays a more important role in our life than just being a
            source of entertainment.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you have already read in the above paragraph that music is
            creativity in the purest form, so it can also be concluded that the
            music is key to creativity. It helps you in improving your mind
            vigorously by making it more artistic and ingenious. No matter, what
            the great invention is, it requires art, creativity and imagination
            that is fulfilled by Music.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also a proven fact that music has the potential to improve
            your listening as well as your understanding ability. When you hear
            a song, you try to understand its lyrics and try to make out what
            the singer wants to convey through his song. Understanding ability
            is enhanced, when a person listens to instrumental music and he uses
            his brain to understand the message, conveyed by the musician,
            without the use of words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Music is an extremely unique way to develop the capability of
            memorising. The best example to prove this sentence is, that you can
            easily learn songs rather than learning your syllabus. The reason
            behind learning a song quickly is that your mind enjoys music.
            Whatever your minds enjoy, it preserves it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, music is said to be a good option to learn new things quickly.
            In your primary classes, you might have learned poems first. Poems
            are being taught to children because they find them interesting and
            easy to learn and retain them in their mind. The music in the poems
            makes it more enjoyable. This is the only reason that you remember
            those poems throughout your life. These days, even the schools
            realize the importance of music, thus they are enhancing the methods
            of teaching by making it interesting with the help of music.
